The GTA V Stand community thrives on openness and sharing, with countless developers contributing their work for free. But some think they can slap a price tag on it. **SafeMoneyLua** is currently being sold for **$15 USD**—a blatant cash grab on what should’ve been freely available.

Well, not anymore.
