# SafeMoneyLua Script - **Breaking Paywalls, Restoring Freedom**

```

```

The GTA V Stand community thrives on openness and sharing, with countless developers contributing their work for free. But some people think they can slap a price tag on it. **SafeMoneyLua** is currently being sold for **$15 USD**—a blatant cash grab on what should’ve been freely available.

Well, not anymore.

### 🎯 **Features**
- **Cash Management Tools**: Secure in-game money drops and loops.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French.
- **Plug & Play**: Works seamlessly with the Stand Mod Menu.

### 🚨 **Why Leak It?**
Because putting a paywall on community-driven content goes against everything modding stands for. This release is a statement: **modding is for everyone, not just for profit.**

### 💡 **Disclaimer**
This script is for personal and educational use. Use responsibly and be aware of the risks.
